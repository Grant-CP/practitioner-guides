# Using Conda and Jupyter

## Conda - Package Managment

Conda is an environment manager for python, and is useful for this project so that you don't have to download each library separately. That being said, the number of dependencies in this repository is fairly low, so you could also download any libraries you see imported at the top of any of the notebooks you open.

To get started with Conda, go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. There are many great resources online. For the most part you should only have to import the environment provided in this repository, and make sure you are actually using it when you run the code.

## Jupyter - Notebooks for Python

The code in this repository is contained in notebooks, as opposed to .py files. The idea behind using notebooks for data science work is to be able to see what you are doing while you are doing it. The intent in this repository is that the user will edit the notebooks provided to change behavior as they see fit, which is a different workflow to using a prebuilt module or library. Another way this repository takes advantage of notebooks is that model inspection is done with interactive viewers.

We strongly recommend using Visual Studio Code for Python notebooks and for this project as whole. The second choice is to use "Jupyter Notebooks." The notebooks contained here require a notebook editory that supports Javascript content. Some editors, such as Jupyter Lab, require additional plugins in order to use interactive content. The notebooks in this repository are also designed with collapsible headings in mind. VS Code supports collapsing code under headings by default.

There are many different ways to use notebooks and different Python notebook editors, so feel free to explore online and find a solution that works best for you.
